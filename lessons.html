            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Below are all of the weekly dialogue comments I had, along with a few other thoughts</h3>
            <p>Hey everyone! I actually really enjoyed reading the Bible Dictionary entries this week because it helped me picture what was going on at that time. I’ve been home with covid this first week and I liked having something to help me imagine being in Jerusalem with Christ instead of having to stare at a wall all day in isolation. I know we haven’t gotten into all of Christ’s miracles yet, but something I’ve thought about this week is how the people he healed must have felt like afterwards. At that time, there were all these Sadducees, Pharisees, Scribes, etc. who were all studying the law and the word of God and teaching people, and then there were all the sick people. Similar in part to people with covid and depending on what their affliction was, the sick people were sometimes kind of left to themselves, or even entirely removed from society. I’ll be back to school soon and I’ll be fine, but at the same time I felt like I got a tiny glimpse of what it must have been like to have to stay away from everyone else while so many others got to go study and learn about the word of God in a society where that was very important. I gained a bigger appreciation for the freedom that people must have felt after Christ healed them. On a similar note, I think a lot of us feel distant or alone even without things like covid to get in the way, and I’m very grateful for the way the Savior can reach across any distance we feel around us, whether that’s physical, mental, emotional, or anything else. Sometimes He heals us, sometimes He just waits with us, but He’s always there and I’m grateful for that.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed what we learned about the contrast between the complexity of the New Testament, and its message and testimony of Christ. Learning about the different accounts and the details that some accounts had, and some didn’t was really interesting. I felt like the whole thing is a bit like life; we all go through different experiences in life, but the goal of all we do is to develop a testimony of Christ and get back home. I felt like the New Testament is similar, in that it has many different ways of looking at Christ, but in the end they all testify of Him and testify of His mission. I also thought learning about the different ways of studying the New Testament was helpful as well (vertical vs horizontal etc.). I feel like we often put ourselves into a box and say, ‘I’m a visual learner’ or ‘I learn better this way’ and while that might be true sometimes academically, sometimes the best way to look at something isn’t the way we’re most comfortable with. One example might be exegesis vs eisegesis. Most of us are fairly comfortable applying the scriptures to our lives, but exegesis takes a lot more work and learning and I know I could personally probably benefit from more exegesis in my studies. Learning about how much work went into getting us the Bible also gave me motivation to be better with my studies and more appreciative of the people that have gone before me to give me the access I have to the words of God.</p>
            <p>I think my favorite quote from this week was Elder Hollands: “After an encounter with the living Son of the living God, nothing is ever again to be as it was before.” So many people learn about Christ as a historical figure, but you can really see a difference in someone’s life it they have really had an experience where they’ve gotten to know Christ as their personal Savior. I didn’t love everything about the way the guy portrayed the Gospel of Mark, but overall, I actually really did enjoy it. I liked imagining that McLean (the guy who performed the dramatization) was a someone living in Christ’s time, telling his kids or grandkids about the things he’d heard and seen. I got a better feel for how the Gospel of Mark is supposed to be read orally, because you really get a feel for the way the stories and teachings would have been transmitted. I could imagine the hope and the wonder, and maybe even a little bit of the skepticism that this man people were talking about was really the messiah. This week I also became grateful for the truths that have been passed down, because just like I didn’t love all the artistic liberties McLean took, I’m sure different people must have shared things in just slightly different ways with others when they passed the stories on. All the more, I’m grateful for the efforts people took so we can have the Bible, even with whatever errors have made it to our version.</p>
            <p>The readings for this week were pretty short, but I thought the insights from class about the genealogy of Christ were very cool. I recently had a conversation with my family about women in the scriptures and while most of the women we talked about were coming from ‘scandalous’ situations, I thought it was interesting how some of them, Mary and Rahab from Jericho, had made large sacrifices to do good. I’m excited to get into the differences of Matthew and Mark. Kind of going back to Mark, I thought the view of the apostles that we got was very cool. Peter has always been one of my heroes for the way he tries, slips up, then tries again. While Mark focused a lot on his mistakes, hearing that Peter likely had input into the writings gave me even more respect for him. I think it’s really a mark of humility if you’re willing to record your mistakes along with the teachings of the Savior of the world for the rest of the world to read for the rest of time. On a similar note, I think it’s cool that the people we talked about in the genealogy of Christ were still able to have a good impact on the world, no matter what their background was. I think all of these examples, especially that of Christ, were also very encouraging for my life in that no matter my past mistakes, if I really repent and move forward, the Lord can use me for good things too.</p>
            <p>I really liked the chapter I read this week. I read: “The Kingdom of God: God's Vision for Society in the Sermon on the Mount” by Jennifer C. Lane. The chapter discussed how in our modern world people often struggle to figure out how best to apply the gospel to our messy world. Specifically, the chapter discussed the challenges of social problems. I thought it was very applicable to our situation today. Lane said she believed that, while a noble goal, an equal society can’t be our sole focus. She said that first, we should seek the kingdom of God, and that as we do so, we will feel a drive to help everyone around us and will want to help them attain a better life. I thought that her order is really significant because one of the difficulties we face is how different everyone’s opinions of what right and wrong is. Because often even right and wrong are hard to agree on, a lot of conflict occurs even among well-meaning people as we try to improve our world. If we all seek the kingdom of God first (though that’s not to say we need to perfectly achieve the kingdom of God before we try to help others), we as a people will have Heavenly Father’s help and guidance as we navigate difficult circumstances and the differences in our society. We as humans can’t fix every bad thing by ourselves. The Savior, however, can. I think this is important because we will keep our focus on the Savior and will be able to watch as he does more to heal the world than we ever could by ourselves. It gave me a lot of hope for the world even with all of the crazy things we have going on.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite takeaways from this week was the way Matthew tries to emphasize the universal reach of the Gospel. I liked the look into his language and the way he’d use specific words multiple times to emphasize his message. I served my mission in Los Angeles and saw a lot of really rough living conditions while I was there and it often weighed on me, but I got to watch the way the Gospel could help everyone’s conditions firsthand. I really like that Matthew, who was a tax collector and someone that society would have looked down on, was able to show the way Christ’s teachings and healing can apply to everyone. I also liked the time we spent looking at the different temptations that Christ experienced and how they apply to our own lives. I think it’s way too easy, speaking about myself and probably in general too, for us to say ‘I’m doing well right now’ and then to slip into complacency, but Christ’s temptations showed us that’s not the case. Even though He was perfect, He too experienced these temptations. I think His focus on Heavenly Father and always moving further along the path is one that’s very helpful. I don’t want to have an attitude of ‘I’m never good enough’ but one that each day is trying to be a bit better. I feel like that kind of an attitude makes it easier to recognize temptations and to then be able to remind yourself of the good we have in the future if we follow Christ.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed reviewing the lessons we’ve had this week in preparation for the midterm. I definitely don’t like midterms themselves, but I did really enjoy the time looking over where we’ve gone so far. I think one of my favorite lessons this week was reading through the chapter about Peter. My chapter was about Peter’s involvement in the restoration and the modern Church today and I really appreciated the extra insight. My chapter talked about the extra authority that his return and transfer of priesthood authority gives to the Church. I haven’t often spent a whole lot of time on that subject, but I’m very grateful for the continuity of Christ’s church. I’m grateful to know that I’m part of the same Church that He established during His lifetime. I also enjoyed reading and discussing the different parables. When I was a little kid, my dad would sometimes tell us ‘adventure stories’ where my siblings and I were the main characters, and I always remember feeling special or cool or even motivated to be better after hearing the picture that my dad painted. I think the parables Christ told could have done something similar  for all of the people He taught, giving them something memorable and personal, something that they could understand and connect to, which would have made the Gospel stick in their hearts that much more. Seeing the way we all connect over stories also helped me feel like I have a connection to the people in Christ’s time and that in the next life we can all come back together, grateful for our Savior.</p>

            <p>I’ve enjoyed looking at the differences in who the Gospels are written for, and this week was no exception. I felt like Luke’s more literary style of writing gave me the biggest sense of a different personality. I also enjoyed learning about his main themes, and this week mercy really stood out to me. With all of the crazy things happening in the world right now, not to mention the usual stresses of school and work and whatever other personal things we have going on, I feel like it’s not surprising that sometimes it’s hard to be patient with people or situations, but I feel like that just makes mercy extra important. I felt like seismic joints were a good metaphor for what mercy does in times like ours. Basically, it’s a section of a wall or floor that’s built to be able to expand or shrink if there’s ever an earthquake, which provides an outlet for the stress and energy of the quake. I feel like mercy can have the same impact today and allow us and the relationships in our lives to flex a little bit as we all try to shift and balance with the changes that come in life. Probably a bit of a nerdy example, but I felt like it was a good fit. I also liked how our discussion about the parts of the classic Christmas story that aren’t quite accurate illustrated the importance of understanding the gospel principles at the core of both the nativity story and the story. It’s not that historicity isn’t important, but that it’s more important to apply the universal gospel principles now since historical events are often relatively restricted as far as who was involved.</p>
            <p>I felt like this week was just a dive into the meat of the book of Luke. I thought a lot about the parable of the sower and I made a couple new connections. I’ve always known that each of us can be each of the different types of grounds, but I’ve never really made a super personal connection with it. This time though, as I read through it, I realized that we all probably have each of the types of grounds in our heart at the same time. It made me think of Jacob 5 and all the work of dunging and pruning that takes place in that chapter and I thought that was a cool connection as well. What I’m saying probably isn’t the most profound haha, but for me it took a little bit of the weight of being perfect now off my shoulders because you can’t cultivate a garden overnight. It takes time and work, and some parts of the garden are going to be harder to work with than others. We each have certain topics or stories or principles that might be harder to accept or understand, and others that are already ready to be planted in some soft ground. Anyway, it just helped me have a longer-term perspective on my personal growth and testimony and is something I’ll be able to take a step back when I’m feeling a little inadequate to remind myself that this process is why I’m here. It’s also kind of funny that it took me so long to make this connection, especially given that my family has a garden that I’ve worked in and spent a lot of time cultivating.</p>
            <p>I really like the metaphor of living water. I went on a camping trip a while ago where we biked the slickrock trail in southern Utah in 100+ degree weather. I brought plenty of water and was fine, but another guy I was with didn’t and he got heatstroke in the first couple of miles. That was really rough because we had another 10 or so miles to go before we could finish and he really wasn’t doing well. We got him some water and Gatorade from other people and it got him through the trail, but he still had a good amount of recovery ahead. I felt like that lined up really well with the class video that talked about the importance of receiving living water from Christ daily. Sometimes life is hot and painful to get through, but if we have enough water from Christ, we can still make it through the difficulties. I also really appreciated the bit about God being a spirit because I’ve never had a great answer to give to people who confronted me with that verse, so Brother Sharp’s explanation was really helpful. I think it’s also interesting that frequently Christ goes by names like the Bread of Life and the Living Waters. Even in our day where we have all sorts of technology and other things that make our lives easier, we all still need to eat, so Christ’s names and metaphors are still something we can all connect with. We don’t need to know exactly what it’s like to live in Jerusalem to understand the necessity of food and by extension, Christ’s influence in our lives.</p>
            <p>I’ve always been really interested in the story of Christ healing the blind man in John 9. I love how pretty Utah (and much of the rest of the world) is as a place and I can’t imagine being born blind and then being introduced suddenly to a whole new world of sight. I feel like spiritually we’re all still pretty blind and have no idea how good things will be if we keep the commandments and I think the day that we really get to see what Heavenly Father has promised us is probably going to be similar to, though probably even more powerful than the day the blind man received his sight. I figure that makes our job to do our best to have faith in Christ and live the kind of life that will help us be ready for that day. I think the response of the Pharisees is really interesting as well. To follow Moses was a good thing because he was a prophet of God, but they had lost sight of what the Lord really wanted them to do. I thought Elder Christofferson’s devotional this last week was really applicable where he said that we need to remember the first and second great commandments (love God and love our neighbor), and also remember the order that they were given in. Elder Christofferson said if we truly follow the first, we will be led naturally to the second. I feel like the Pharisees we read about had lost sight of both commandments and I definitely recognize that I’ve had moments of the same weakness myself, so I was grateful for the reminder to focus on our Heavenly Father this week.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed Elder Holland’s talk. It’s one I’ve heard multiple times over the years and I’ve always picked up something new. This go around I thought about Peter’s response to the death of the Savior and how many times I’ve felt something similar. The way Elder Holland portrayed it, with his imagined ‘I go a fishing’ comment, portrayed a sense of loss and confusion that I’ve definitely felt at least in little bits. After certain events where something good I had going ended, there were definitely times where I felt at a complete loss as to what I should do next. There were a few times that I basically went right back to what I had been doing before the good had happened because I didn’t know what else to do. Eventually I figured out how to incorporate the things I’d learned back into my life but I also felt for Peter and his position as well. I can’t imagine how difficult it must have been to seemingly lose the Savior and then to have to figure out what on earth you’re supposed to do next. I think one lesson I learned from those experiences was that instead of waiting for the Lord to tell me what to do when things go ‘wrong,’ I can immediately start asking for direction to help me in my decisions. I get that I’m not the only person to ever need that lesson, but it was a good reminder this week and I liked the chance to read a conference talk with our readings.</p>
